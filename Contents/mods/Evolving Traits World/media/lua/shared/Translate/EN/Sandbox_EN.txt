If you sleep outside of it, you lose some schedule integrity. Not sleeping for more than 24h also starts to damage your sleep schedule. Mod tracks at which hours you like to sleep by checking midpoint of your last sleep, so it's possible to shift your schedule to different hours.<br>---Technical description, don't read this if you don't want to meta-game much---<br>Every time you sleep, mod tracks midpoint of your sleep, so if u sleep between 23:00 and 05:30, midpoint would be 03:45, and it would be your optimal sleeping hour. If you sleep within +-6h you get progress to your SleepHealthiness bar. Goes from -200 to 200. Check is made every 10 min, you get + 0.167 to said bar, so essentially 1h of sleeping in correct schedule gives +1 to bar. Sleeping outside of it removes 0.167 from bar every 10 min. After not sleeping for more than 24h you start getting -0.167 every ten minutes. If your bar below -100, you get Sleepyhead. If it's above 100, you get Wakeful. Starting with either trait will set starting value of the bar to max/min point, so for Wakeful +200 and for Sleepyhead -200.",
