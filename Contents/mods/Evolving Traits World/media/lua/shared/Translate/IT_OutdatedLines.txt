How it works that it slowly decays opposite counter based if you're outside/inside every 1 min regardless of your mental state. For example, setting this to 0.1 and being inside will slowly make you less afraid of outside by adding 0.1 to outside counter every minute. Makes 0 sense but you guys complained a lot about having both Agoraphobic and Claustrophobic so there. Setting it to 0 will have no effect on counters. Recommended values are 0.1 to 0.5",
