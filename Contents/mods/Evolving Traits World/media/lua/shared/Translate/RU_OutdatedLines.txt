		Sandbox_ETW_AsthmaticCounter_tooltip = "What value on counter you should reach to lose asthmatic trait. Running or exercising in cold temperature decreases counter, the colder it is, faster the decrease. If you're outside, it decreases even faster. If you have smoker, it decreases even faster. Additionally, having smoker slowly decreases the counter when you run even if weather is fine. Reaching the counter removes the trait. Counter slowly increases by itself as long as you're not running or sprinting and breathing air warmer than 0 degrees Celsius. On top of that, it increases based on your Fitness level and current endurance level. Having smoker halves increases rate. Having asthmatic halves it again.",

		Sandbox_ETW_OutdoorsmanCounter_tooltip = "This allows you to gain a trait by spending time outside and being exposed to various weather conditions. The more adverse the weather conditions are, the more quickly you will gain the trait. Being inside slowly loses progress. Reaching counter will gain the trait, dropping down to opposite of it (for example, -500k with default settings) will lose it",

		Sandbox_ETW_SmokerCounter_tooltip = "Upon reaching this value on the counter, you'll get Smoker trait. When dropping to opposite of it, you'll lose it. Counter boundaries are -2x the counter to 2x counter<br><br> How it works:Every smoke you take increases your addiction counter. Bigger breaks you take between smokes, less the increase. Smoking while being panicked or stressed increases counter much faster, based on level of panic and stress. Not smoking slowly decays the counter. Being panicked or stressed slows decay rate.",
