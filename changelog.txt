v.8.0.0 - Proper Types and Classes

General:
	- Huge internal refactor and documentation work, mostly just coding stuff and making project work better with IDE. Non-relevant to average player, unless I broke stuff.
	- Bloodlust gain/lose is now affected by general level of your bloodied clothes. Has only positive net gain. Having no bloodied clothes doesn't change speed of getting/losing the trait. Having bloodied clothes makes it easier to get the trait and harder to lose it.
	- Made Bloodlust softcap less harsh (you can go above 100% meter fill easier)
	- Bravery system now will not allow you to earn next trait in progression until previous trait is gone (if it's negative) or present (if it's positive)
	- Added ModOption to disable Smoker bar display in UI
Fixes:
	- Cold System had a bug when Delayed Traits System was enabled
	- Fixed some traits being dynamic when they shouldn't be and vice versa
