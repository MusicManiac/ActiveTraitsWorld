v.4.1.2

General:
	- Adjusted smoker default values, so it's faster to lose smoker. "Smoking Addiction Decay Multiplier" Default value 1 -> 8, Max value 100 -> 1000.
Fixes:
	- Fixed Smoker leaving stress from cigarettes on your character upon losing the trait
	- Removed Graceful from submod marking it dynamic while it's not (I'll make it dynamic, just a bit later). It still will be marked with D if you have SOTO running, 'cuz SOTO makes it dynamic too.
